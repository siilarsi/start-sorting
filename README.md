# start-sorting
Kitchen Sorter is a simple, visual tool to organise your kitchen layout. Quickly design your kitchen’s grid and place appliances, utensils, and items into cabinets, drawers, and shelves to keep track of where everything goes.

When you first load the application you’ll see a splash screen introducing the tool and describing the basic controls.
Click **Start Sorting** to open the layout editor.
The main page then shows a responsive 8×4 grid that displays layout slots for your units.
